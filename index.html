        <h3>C++ and Python!</h3>
        <p>I have created several projects using the above two languages. Let me list some of them!
        <br /> <br /> 1. Used Python to work on a Kaggle competition for Small Group Discovery (Algorithm and Data Structure Analysis). Used Logistic Regression to predict voting outcomes of few thousand people based on their replies to 100 informal questions.
      <br /> <br />2. Developed a 2D car racing game with 3 other group members using the language ‘Processing’ which runs on Java. Earned 93/100 for the group project and High Distinction in the subject. <br />
      <br />3. For Group Project in Object Oriented Programming, my group and I made a Timetable Planner using C++.</p>

        <h3>HTML, CSS and JavaScript!</h3>
        <p>This one doesn't need much saying. However, I have also created a restaurant booking site with my friends for a university class! Ask me more about it!</p>

        <h3>Gamification and Scheduling Intern at<a href="https://tcpinpoint.com">TCPinpoint</a> (August 2019 - November 2019)</h3>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <p>
            I research into gamification strategies and reported on what might have been relevant to TCP user segments.
            I also worked with the team to design and write project management algorithms
            and  designed front-end interfaces to utilise scheduling algorithms and gamifications strategies.
            Finally, I conducted several User Acceptance Testing and reported the results to Jira.<br />
